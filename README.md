# SecureQR-A-Full-Fledged-Tool-for-Enhanced-Data-Security
A Full-Fledged tool that does Image Steganography process by generating a random QR every time in which the steganography process is to be done and for a further layer of defense Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is used. Further, the Stego work and the cover work are analysed (i.e.,) (PSNR) and (SSIM).
